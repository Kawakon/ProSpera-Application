This application was developed to test the functionality of ProSpera cameras quickly and easily. Upon testing the ProSpera camera, the application will open the image captured by the device. These images will also be saved on your Windows Desktop in /Prospera/test_imgs. Logger files that contain the ProSpera camera outputs and any errors can also be found on your Desktop in /Prospera/log.
