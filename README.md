Python application to test ProSpera camera

In this repository, I have developed a Python script to test an embedded camera device, called the ProSpera Camera, that is used to monitor the growth of crops. The ProSpera camera would be fastened 
to a moving pivot and directed towards the section of the field to capture images of the plants growing on the crop field. The purpose of testing the ProSpera camera was to identify and compile a list 
of any bugs found in the devices. The Python script would connect to the ProSpera camera via a SSH (Secure Shell) connection and execute commands to control the camera from a Linux terminal. 
I also converted the Python script into a file can be run as an Windows executable application to avoid installing a Python interpreter on a user's machine, using the Python tool PyInstaller.
